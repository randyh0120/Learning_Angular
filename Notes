Learning Angular and Typescript

I use Typescript in this Project.

Http Endpoints are like the ports.
Http Requests are like ships.
Data is like cargo on the ship.

// e2e
The e2e folder allows us to write tests for our software. Simulating a real user.

test.ts allows us to set up our tests.

// Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
This is when you change somehting in your app and Angular recompiles everything to load the new changes.

// Styles
All the styles are saved and loaded in a styles.js file on runtime.
