Learning Angular and Typescript

I use Typescript in this Project.

Http Endpoints are like the ports.
Http Requests are like ships.
Data is like cargo on the ship.

//// Angular
// e2e
The e2e folder allows us to write tests for our software. Simulating a real user.

test.ts allows us to set up our tests.

// Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
This is when you change somehting in your app and Angular recompiles everything to load the new changes.

// Styles
All the styles are saved and loaded in a styles.js file on runtime.


//// Typescript
Typescript is a superscript of JS.

Typescript is Strongly Typed while JS is not.
Object-oriented features that are missing in JS like classes, generics, etc.
Can catch Compile-time errors before going live.
Typescript has great tools.

We must transpile our Typescript code into --> JS code

// tsconfig.json
Must create and update this file when using tsc in the terminal or an error will be thrown. Use the same config file from the angular hello-world project.

// let vs var
use let anytime you can in TS. It will compile to var when you create the JS version.
